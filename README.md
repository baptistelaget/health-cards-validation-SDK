# SMART Health Cards Validation SDK

This project provides a tool to help implementers of the [SMART Health Card Framework](https://smarthealth.cards/) validate the artifacts they produce. The package's version number, currently `0.4.3`, matches the [specification version](https://smarthealth.cards/changelog/) the tool validates.

## Setup

1. Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed on your system; the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version is recommended for both. [OpenSSL 1.1.1](https://www.openssl.org/) is also needed to validate certificate chains which could be present in issuer JSON Web Keys (`x5c` value); if absent, chain validation is skipped.

2. Get the source, for example using git:

                git clone -b main https://github.com/microsoft/health-cards-validation-SDK.git
                cd health-cards-validation-SDK

3. Build the npm package:

                npm install
                npm run build

3. Optionally, run the tests:

                npm test

The tests download and validate, among other things, the spec [examples](https://smarthealth.cards/examples/). A breaking spec change might invalidate the downloaded examples, which can be refreshed using:

                npm run fetch-examples -- --force

The tool can be updated to the latest version by running (assuming you obtained it with git):

                npm run update-validator

### Running in Docker

```json
docker build -t health-cards-validation .

docker run --rm -it \
  -v /path/to/inputs:/inputs \
  health-cards-validation /bin/bash
```

## Using the tool

To validate health card artifacts, use the `shc-validator.ts` script, or simply call `node .` from the package root directory, using the desired options:

                Usage: shc-validator [options]
                
                Options:
                  -v, --version              display specification and tool version
                  -p, --path <path>          path of the file(s) to validate. Can be repeated for the qr and qrnumeric types, to provide multiple file chunks (default: [])
                  -t, --type <type>          type of file to validate (choices: "fhirbundle", "jwspayload", "jws", "healthcard", "qrnumeric", "qr", "jwkset")
                  -l, --loglevel <loglevel>  set the minimum log level (choices: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "fatal", default: "warning")
                  -o, --logout <path>        output path for log (if not specified log will be printed on console)
                  -f, --fhirout <path>       output path for the extracted FHIR bundle
                  -k, --jwkset <key>         path to trusted issuer key set
                  -e, --exclude <error>      error to exclude. Can be repeated. Valid options: "openssl-not-available",
                                             "invalid-issuer-url", "invalid-key-x5c" (default: [])
                  -h, --help                 display help for command

For example, to validate a `data.smart-health-card` file, call:

                node . --path data.smart-health-card --type healthcard

To validate a `QR.png` file, call:

                 node . --path QR.png --type qr

Multiple `path` options can be provided for QR artifacts (`qrnumeric` and `qr` types) split in multiple files , one for each chunk. For example, to validate a numeric QR code split in three chunks `QR1.txt`, `QR2.txt`, `QR3.txt`, call:

                 node . --path QR1.txt --path QR2.txt --path QR3.txt --type qrnumeric

The log output can be stored into a file using the `--logout` option. The extracted FHIR bundle can be stored into a file using the `--fhirout` option.

The supported file types, as expressed with the `--type` option, are:
 - *fhirbundle*: a JSON-encoded FHIR bundle
 - *jwspayload*: a JSON Web Signature (JWS) payload, encoding a health card
 - *jws*: a (signed) JSON Web Signature (JWS), encoding a health card
 - *healthcard*: a health card file
 - *qrnumeric*: a numeric QR code encoding a health card
 - *qr*: a QR code image encoding a health card
 - *jwkset*: a JSON Web Key (JWK) Set, encoding the issuer public signing key. This superceedes downloading the key from the well-known location.

The tool outputs validation information, depending on the verbosity level, in particular, the parsed FHIR bundle is printed at the `info` verbosity log level. The tool tries to continue parsing the artefact even if a warning or error occurred. Certain errors can be suppressed from the output using the `--exclude` option.

Issuer signing public keys (encoded in a JSON Web Key Set) can be validated before being uploaded to their well-known URL. To validate a `issuerPublicKeys.json` JSON Web Key Set (JWK), call:

                node . --path issuerPublicKeys.json --type jwkset

## Validating tests

The tool currently verifies proper encoding of the:
 - QR code image (single file or split in chunks)
 - Numeric QR data (header, content)
 - SMART Health Card file (schema)
 - JWS (schema, deflate compression, format, size limits, signature, issuer key retrieval, x5c cert chain validation)
 - JWS payload (schema)
 - FHIR bundle (basic schema validation).
 - Issuer JSON Key Set (schema, algorithm, EC Curve, ID, type, usage)

Validation of the FHIR bundle is currently limited. Extensive tests and conformance to the [Vaccination & Testing Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/) can be performed by the [FHIR validator](https://wiki.hl7.org/Using_the_FHIR_Validator) tool.
